# Hangman game

### [Demo](https://hangman-game-react.netlify.com/) site available on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Simple hangman game ~~inspired~~ stolen from [netguru/frontend-recruitment-task](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task) in order to practice React :)

#### This project is not part of the recruitment process.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [hangman-api](http://hangman-api.herokuapp.com/api)

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

### `npm run develop`
